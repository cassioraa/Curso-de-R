#' @section Notes: The dependent variables deaths, heart, and liver can be each regressed against alcohol as nice simple regression examples. The conventional wisdom is that wine is good for the heart but not for the liver, something that is apparent in the regressions. Because the number of observations is small, this can be a good data set to illustrate calculation of the OLS estimates and statistics.
